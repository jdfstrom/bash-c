# bash-c
Isn't it funny how # is used to start comments in bash, but used to mark pragmas in c?
What if this was abused to produce valid c programs whose source code is a bash script that does the same thing?


* hello_world.c: A simple "hello world" program. Takes no input. Prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
* hello.c: A slightly more complicated program. Takes a command from the command line and prints "Hello, <argument> !" to the console.
* fib.c: Takes an integer, n, from the command line args and prints the nth fibonacci number.
